## Sets and elements

A set ($X$) is a collection of objects. A particular object within a set ($x$) is known as an element of that set. The idea that x is an element of X is written in mathematical notation as $x \in X$.

Suppose that there are elements that do not belong to $X$. Let $y$ be one such element. The idea that $y$ is not an element of $X$ is written in mathematical
notation as $y \notin X$ . 

A set that does not contain any elements is said to be empty. An empty set is denoted by either $\varnothing$ or $\{\}$.

There are two fundamental ways of defining a particular set:
- The first of these is to exhaustively list all of the elements of the set.
    - Example 1: $X = {1, 2, 3}$
    - Example 2: $Y = {1, 2, 3, · · · , 100}$
    - Example 3: $\mathbb{N} = {1, 2, 3, · · · }$
- The second of these is to specify one or more properties that characterise all of the elements in the set.
    - Example 4: $X = {n \in \mathbb{N} : n < 4}$
    - Example 5: $Y = {n ∈ \mathbb{N} : n \leqslant 100}$

### Russell's Paradox

It would be nice if we could always associate some type of set with any particular property that we might consider. In other words, it would be nice if for any property $\mathbb{A}$, we could form a set $\{x \in X : \mathbb{A}(x) \text{ is true}\}$ that consisted of all of the elements that satisfy this property. Unfortunately, this is not the case.

This was established by Bertrand Russell. He did this by developing the following paradox. 

Let $\mathbb{A}$ be the property “is a set and does not belong to itself”. Suppose that $A$ is the set of all sets that possess property $\mathbb{A}$. Is $A \in A$?

If $A \in A$, then it must be the case that $A$ possesses property $\mathbb{A}$. This means that $A \notin A$. Contradiction! Thus it must be the case that $A \notin A$. But if $A$ is a set and $A \notin A$, then it clearly possesses property $\mathbb{A}$. Thus $A \in A$. Contradiction. Thus it must be the case that $A \in A$. 

We have a paradox. It cannot be the case that both $A \in A$ and $A \notin A$. 

One possible resolution to Russell’s paradox is to not allow mathematical objects like this particular $A$ to be considered a set.
