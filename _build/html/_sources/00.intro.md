- sufficient lecture notes
- downloadable as markdown or pdf
- GitHub based
- submit issues and typos through the provided button
- **Latest version of the notes a day before the lecture**
- check for the updates in the morning

## How tutorials will be conducted?

- practical exercises 
- posted with the corresponding lecture
- try to solve the exercises before the tutorial
- exercises solved and discussed at the tutorial
- **participation is not mandatory but highly recommended**
- if you solve all tutorial excesses, you will be able to solve all practical problems in the exams
- solutions posted a week after

**Tutorials start on week 2**


## Where to send your questions

1. Administrative questions: RSE admin

  - **Bronwyn Cammack** Senior School Administrator
  - Email: enquiries.rse@anu.edu.au

  - "I can not register for the tutorial group"

2. Content related questions: please, refer to the tutors

  - "I don't understand why this function is convex"

3. Other questions: to Fedor

  - "I'm working hard but still can not keep up"
  - "Can I please have extra assignment for more practice"

## Attendance

- please, **do not** use email for *instructional* questions

- instead make use of the office hours

- attendance of tutorials is *very highly* recommended\
You will make your life much easier this way

- attendance of lectures is *highly* recommended\
But not mandatory

## Comments for lectures notes/slides

- Cover exactly what you are required to know
- Code inserts are the exception, they are not assessable

In particular, you need to know:
- The definitions from the notes
- The facts from the notes
- How to apply facts and definitions

If a concept in not in the lecture notes, it is not assessable

## Definitions and facts

The lectures notes/slides are full of definitions and facts.

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

Functions $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is called *continuous at* $x$ if, for any sequence $\{x_n\}$ converging to $x$, we have $f(x_n) \rightarrow f(x)$.
```

Possible exam question: "Show  that if functions $f$ and $g$ are continuous at $x$, so is $f+g$."

You should start the answer with the definition of continuity: 

"Let $\{x_n\}$ be any sequence converging to $x$. We need to show that $f(x_n) + g(x_n) \rightarrow f(x) + g(x)$. To see this, note that ..."

## Facts

In the lecture notes/slides you will often see

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important
The only $N$-dimensional subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$ is $\mathbb{R}^N$.
```
This means either:
- theorem
- proposition
- lemma
- true statement

All well known results. You need to remember them, have some intuition for, and be able to apply.

## Note on Assessments

Assessable = definitions and facts + last year level math + a few simple steps of logic

Exams and tests will award:
- Hard work
- Deeper understanding of the concepts

In each question there will be a *easy* path to the solution

## Reading materials

**Primary reference:** lecture slides

**Book:**

***Essential mathematics for economic analysis (fifth edition)***
by Sydsæter, Hammond, Strøm and Carvajal

{cite:ps}`sydsaeter2016`:

```{figure} _static/img/bibliography/shsc2016.png
:height: 300 px
:align: center
```

- each lecture will reference book chapters in SHSC2016
- each lecture will give additional references for self-study

## Key points for the administrative part

- Tutorials start next week, **please register before the next lecture**
- Course content = what’s in lecture notes/slides
- Lecture slides are available online and will be updated throughout the semester

## What you will learn in the course

*See [home page](https://optim.iskh.me/00.index.html)*

## Further material and self-learning

- Each lecture will suggest some material for further reading and learning

- Today: **The Wason Selection Task** logical problem

- Mathematics relies on rules of logic
- Yet, for human brain applying mathematical logic may be difficult, and dependent on the domain

- Further learning: [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/iR97LBgpsl8) on Wason selection task
