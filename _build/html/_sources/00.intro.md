# Welcome 

Course title: **"Mathematical Techniques for Economic Analysis"**

- Compulsory first math course in the *Master of Economics* program

## Plan for this lecture

1. Organization
2. Administrative topics
3. Course content
5. Self-learning materials

## Instructor

**Fedor Iskhakov**
Professor of Economics at RSE

- Office: 1021 HW Arndt Building
- Email: fedor.iskhakov@anu.edu.au
- Web: [fedor.iskh.me](https://fedor.iskh.me)
- Contact hours: TBA

## Timetable

**Face-to-face:**

- Lectures: TBA

**Online:**

- Echo-360 recordings on Wattle
- All notes and materials on (domain TBA)

Face-to-face is strictly preferred

## Course web pages

- [Wattle](https://wattlecourses.anu.edu.au/course/view.php?id=TBA)
Schedule, announcements, teaching team contacts, recordings, assignment, grades

- [Online notes](domain TBA)
Lecture notes, slides, assignment tasks

- Lecture slides should appear online the previous day before the lecture
- Details on assessment including the exam instructions will appear on Wattle


## Tutorials

- Enrollments open on *Wattle*

Tutorial questions
- posted on the course website
- not assessed, help you learn and prepare

Tutorials start on week 2


## Tutors
TBA


## Prerequisites

None specifically; [Course overview](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2024/course/EMET7001) and
[Class summary](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2024/course/EMET7001/First%20Semester/4098)

Prior knowledge of maths, however, will be helpful:
- basic algebra
- basic calculus
- some idea of what a matrix is, etc.


## Focus?

This course will teach you the foundational mathematical concepts that you will need for other courses in your degree.  For example, [Optimisation for Economics and Financial Economics (ECON6102)](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/course/ECON6012) is the compulsory second maths course in the *Master of Economics* program.  ECON6102 is a general course on mathematical modeling for economics and financial economics, but optimization will be an important and recurring theme.


## Assessment

TBA


## Questions

1. Administrative questions: RSE admin

  - **Bronwyn Cammack** Senior School Administrator
  - Email: enquiries.rse@anu.edu.au

  - "I can not register for the tutorial group"

2. Content related questions: please, refer to the tutors

  - "I don't understand why this function is convex"

3. Other questions: to Fedor

  - "I'm working hard but still can not keep up"
  - "Can I please have extra assignment for more practice"

## Attendance

- Please, **do not** use email for *instructional* questions\Instead make use of the office hours

- Attendance of tutorials is *very highly* recommended\
You will make your life much easier this way

- Attendance of lectures is *highly* recommended\
But not mandatory

## Comments for lectures notes/slides

- Cover exactly what you are required to know
- Code inserts are the exception, they are not assessable

In particular, you need to know:
- The definitions from the notes
- The facts from the notes
- How to apply facts and definitions

If a concept in not in the lecture notes, it is not assessable

## Definitions and facts

The lectures notes/slides are full of definitions and facts.

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

Functions $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is called *continuous at* $x$ if, for any sequence $\{x_n\}$ converging to $x$, we have $f(x_n) \rightarrow f(x)$.
```

Possible exam question: "Show  that if functions $f$ and $g$ are continuous at $x$, so is $f+g$."

You should start the answer with the definition of continuity: 

"Let $\{x_n\}$ be any sequence converging to $x$. We need to show that $f(x_n) + g(x_n) \rightarrow f(x) + g(x)$. To see this, note that ..."

## Facts

In the lecture notes/slides you will often see

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important
The only $N$-dimensional subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$ is $\mathbb{R}^N$.
```
This means either:
- theorem
- proposition
- lemma
- true statement

All well known results. You need to remember them, have some intuition for, and be able to apply.

## Note on Assessments

Assessable = definitions and facts + a few simple steps of logic

Exams and tests will award:
- Hard work
- Deeper understanding of the concepts

In each question there will be an *easy* path to the solution
