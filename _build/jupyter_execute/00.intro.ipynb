For example, [Optimisation for Economics and Financial Economics (ECON6102)](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/course/ECON6012) is the compulsory second maths course in the *Master of Economics* program.  ECON6102 is a general course on mathematical modeling for economics and financial economics, but optimization will be an important and recurring theme.\n",
