# ☕️ Wason selection paradox

- Mathematics relies on rules of logic
- Yet, for human brain applying mathematical logic may be difficult, and dependent on the domain

- Peter Cathcart Wason (1924 – 2003)
- cognitive psychologist at University College, London
- pioneered the psychology of reasoning

```{admonition} The Wason selection task
:class: tip

Given four cards showing 3, 8, blue and red faces, which
cards have to be flipped over to ensure the rule
`if card shows even number on one side, the other side is blue`
is satisfied?

Let's play Wason Selection Task at [Mentimeter](https://www.menti.com/alk6yjg64gyf)
```

````{dropdown} Analysis of Wason selection task

- Let $P$ denote `card shows even number on one side`
- Let $Q$ denote `the side is blue`

| Numbver | Color | $P$ | $Q$ | Rule is satisfied | 
| ---- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Even | Blue | True | True | Yes |
| Even | Red | True | False | No |
| Odd | Blue | False | True | Yes |
| Odd | Red | False | False | Yes |

````

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

$\implies$ denotes **logical implication**:  
If whenever logical statment $P$ is true, $Q$ is also true, we write $P \implies Q$.
```

- the rule we are checking is $P \implies Q$
- it is only brocken in case $P$ is True and $Q$ is False
- therefore the two cards that have to be flipped are 
    - Even, $P$ is True
    - Red, $Q$ is False
