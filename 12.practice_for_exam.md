# ðŸ”¬ Practice questions

Please, use the following materials to practice for the exam:

2. Exercises with partial solutions from the relevant chapters in the textbook referenced in each lecture topic.

3. ðŸ“– "Solved Problems of Mathematics with Applications to Economics and Finance" by JosÃ© A. Rodrigues-Neto, downloadable form the Wattle course website [link](https://wattlecourses.anu.edu.au/course/view.php?id=42532#section-0)
