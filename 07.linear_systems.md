## What is a system of linear equations

- Equations

- Matrix notation


## Gaussian elimination

- Augmented matrix notation for the system of linear equations (adding the RHS of the system as an extra column)

- Algorithm for solving systems of linear equations using a set of elementary raw operations:
  - swap the positions of two rows
  - multiply a row by a nonzero scalar
  - add one raw to another

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

A matrix is said to be in *row echelon form* if it satisfies the following conditions:

- all rows having only zero entries are at the bottom of the matrix
- leading entry (first non-zero entry) of each row is to the right of the leading entry of the row above it

```

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

A matrix is said to be in *reduced row echelon form* if it satisfies the following conditions:
- it is in row echelon form
- the leading entry in each row is 1
- each column containing a leading 1 has all other entries equal to zero

```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

Every matrix has a unique reduced row echelon form.
```

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

Every matrix can be transformed to echelon and reduced echelon form using Gaussian elimination.
