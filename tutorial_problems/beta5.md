To show that $x^2+y^2-10x+14y+58 = 0$ is a circle, we argue like this:
first, rearrange the equation to read $(x^2-10x) + (y^2 +14y) = -58$.
Completing the two squares gives: $(x^2-10x+5^2) + (y^2 +14y+7^2) = -58 + 25 + 49$.
This equation becomes $(x-5)^2 + (y+7)^2 = 16$,
whose graph is a circle with center $(5,-7)$ and radius $\sqrt{16} = 4$.

Use this method to find the center and the radius of the two circles with equations:

- $x^2+y^2+10x-6y+30 = 0$
- $3x^2+3y^2+18x-24y = -39$
