Suppose that the cost of producing $Q$ units of a commodity is given by $C(Q)=1,000+300Q+Q2$. We have

$$
C(0)=1,000+300(0)+02 =1,000+0+0 = 1,000
$$

$$
\begin{array}{c}
C(100) = 1,000+300(100)+(100)^2 = 1,000+30,000+10,000 = 41,000 \\
C(101) = 1,000+300(101)+(101)^2 = 1,000+30,300+10,201 = 41,501 \\
C(101) - C(100) = 41, 501 - 41, 000 = 501
\end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{c}
C(Q + 1) = 1,000 + 300(Q+1) + (Q+1)^2 = \\
= 1,000+300Q+300+Q2 +2Q+1 = 1,301 + 302Q + Q^2,\\
C(Q+1)-C(Q) = 1,301 + 302Q+ Q^2 - (1,000+300Q+Q^2) = \\
= 1,301+302Q+Q^2 -1,000-300 Q-Q^2 =301+2Q.
\end{array}
$$

Note that $C(Q+1)-C(Q)$ is the difference between the total cost of producing $Q+1$ units of a commodity and the total cost of producing $Q$ units of that commodity. As such, it is the incremental cost that is incurred by producing the $(Q + 1)$-th unit of the commodity. Since the incremental increase is a one unit increase in this case, this incremental cost is known as the **marginal cost** of the $(Q + 1)$-th unit of the commodity.
