Let $a = (a_1,a_2) = (2,4)$ and $b = (b_1,b_2) = (5,y)$. The distance between these two points is

$$
\begin{array}{c}
d(a,b)=\sqrt{(b_1 -a_1)^2 +(b_2 -a_2)^2}
=\sqrt{(5-2)^2 +(y-4)^2}
=\sqrt{32 +(y-4)^2}
=\sqrt{9+(y-4)^2}.
\end{array}
$$

Given the distance $d(a,b)=\sqrt{13}$, we have

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\sqrt{9+(y-4)^2} = \sqrt{13}\\
9+(y-4)^2 = 13\\
(y-4)^2 = 4\\
y-4 = \pm \sqrt{4}\\
y = 4 \pm 2
\end{array}
$$

Thus we know that either (i) y = 6 or (ii) y = 2.

The set of points that are $\sqrt{13}$ away from $(2,5)$ is a circle centered at $(2,4)$ with radius $\sqrt{13}$. 
The set of points whose x-coordinate is 5 form a vertical straight line parallel to the yâ€“axis. There are two points of the form $(5,y)$ that are exactly $\sqrt{13}$ units distance from $(2,4)$ because the vertical line given by the equation $x = 5$ cuts the circle of radius $\sqrt{13}$ that is centred on the point $(2,4)$ in exactly two places.
