Note: the answers to this question was sourced from the answer key to the exercises in Shannon (1995). This answer key was written by John Shannon and Ted McDonald.

**(a)**

$$
\begin{array}{l}
S = P(1 + i)^n \\
= 1000000(1 + 0.08)^{10} \\ 
= 2158925
\end{array}
$$


**(b)**

$$
\begin{array}{l}
S = R \left[ \frac{(1 + i)^n - 1}{i} \right] \\
= 140000 \left[ \frac{(1 + 0.08)^{10} - 1}{0.08} \right] \\
= 2028118.75
\end{array}
$$

**(c)**
A winner is better off receiving the prize money of $1000000 immediately as long as all other relevant factors such as the amount of tax paid is the same in both cases.

**(d)**

$$
\begin{array}{l}
S = R (1 + i) \left[ \frac{(1 + i)^n - 1}{i} \right] \\
= (2028118.70)(1 + 0.08) \\
= 2190368.20
\end{array}
$$

The winner is better off accepting the annuity if it is an annuity due with payments at the start of each year.



**(e)**

When interest is compounded continuously but payments are made yearly we have a general annuity.  We use the same formulae we used with ordinary annuities but the interest rate is now the effective interest rate.  This is found using the formula for effective interest rates with continuous compounding.

$$
\begin{array}{l}
r = e^i - 1 = e^{0.08} - 1 = 0.083287 \text{ or } 8.3287\%
\end{array}
$$

In part (a)

$$
S = Pe^{rt} = 1000000e^{(0.08)10} = 2225540.90
$$

In part (b)

$$
S = 140000 \left[ \frac{(1 + 0.083287)^{10} - 1}{0.083287} \right]
= 2060051.80
$$

As before we chose the immediate payment.

With an annuity due

$$
S = R(1 + r) \left[ \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r} \right]
= (2060051.80)(1.083287) = 2231627.30
$$

As before we choose the 'annuity due'.
