Let $U\left(q_{1}, q_{2}\right)$ be a utility function that represents a particular individual's preferences over bundles of strictly positive amounts of each of two commodities. Suppose that this utility function is at least twice continuously differentiable. The indifference curve corresponding to
utility level $\hat{U}$ for this individual is a graphical representation of the level-set for this utility function that corresponds to utility-level $\hat{U}$. It is formally defined to be

$$
U^{0}\left(q_{1}, q_{2}, \hat{U}\right)=\left\{\left(q_{1}, q_{2} \in \mathbb{R}_{++}^{2}: U\left(q_{1}, q_{2}\right)=\hat{U}\right\}\right.
$$

The equation that describes this curve takes the form $q_{2}=f\left(q_{1}\right)$, for some function $f$. The function $f$ is implicitly defined by the equation

$$
U\left(q_{1}, q_{2}\right)=\hat{U}
$$

Use the equation $U\left(q_{1}, q_{2}\right)=\hat{U}$ to show that the slope of the above indifference curve is given by

$$
\left.\frac{d q_{2}}{d q_{1}}\right|_{U=\hat{U}}=-M R S_{1,2}\left(q_{1}, q_{2}\right)
$$

where MRS stands for the marginal rate of substitution, and is defined to be

$$
M R S_{1,2}\left(q_{1}, q_{2}\right)=\frac{\left(\frac{\partial U\left(q_{1}, q_{2}\right)}{\partial q_{1}}\right)}{\left(\frac{\partial U\left(q_{1}, q_{2}\right)}{\partial q_{2}}\right)}
$$
