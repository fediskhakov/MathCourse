Consider the matrix equation $A x=b$ where

$$
A=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & -p_{1} & -p_{2} \\
-p_{1} & U_{11} & U_{12} \\
-p_{2} & U_{21} & U_{22}
\end{array}\right)
$$

$x=\left(\frac{\partial \lambda}{\partial p_{1}}, \frac{\partial x_{1}}{\partial p_{1}}, \frac{\partial x_{2}}{\partial p_{1}}\right)^{T}$ and $b=\left(x_{1}, \lambda, 0\right)^{T}$. This equation might have been derived by conducting a comparative static exercise on the first-order conditions of a consumer's budget-constrained utility maximisation problem. Use Cramer's rule to find the comparative static effects $\frac{\partial x_{1}}{\partial p_{1}}$ and $\frac{\partial x_{2}}{\partial p_{1}}$.
