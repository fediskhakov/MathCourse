Apply Gauss-Jordan elimination to an appropriate augmented row matrix to solve the following system of equations:

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{ccccc}
3 x+3 y+6 z & = & 12 & \cdots & (\text { Equation } 1) \\
x-3 y+5 z & = & 5 & \cdots & (\text { Equation } 2) \\
2 x+10 y-3 z & = & 0 & \cdots & (\text { Equation } 3)
\end{array}\right\} .
$$
