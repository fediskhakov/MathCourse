Consider a company that purchases cocoa in Ghana, ships it from
Ghana to the United Kingdom, and sells it in the United Kingdom.
The company is a monopsonist (that is, the only purchaser) in the
cocoa market in Ghana. It is also a monopolist (that is, the only
seller) in the cocoa market in the United Kingdom. 

The price that the company receives per tonne of cocoa that it sells in the United
Kingdom is given by the United Kingdom Cocoa Inverse Demand Equation, $P_{UK} = \alpha_1 - \sqrt{Q}$, where $Q$ is the number of tonnes of cocoa that it sells in the United Kingdom.

The price that it must pay per tonne of cocoa that it purchases in Ghana is given by the
Ghana Cocoa Inverse Supply Equation, $P_G = \alpha_2 + \sqrt{Q}$, where $Q$ is the number of tonnes of cocoa that it purchases in Ghana. 

It costs the company $\gamma$ per tonne of cocoa to ship it from Ghana to the United Kingdom. No cocoa is lost or spoiled in this process. As such, you may assume that the quantity of cocoa purchased in Ghana, the quantity shipped from Ghana to the United Kingdom, and the quantity sold in the United Kingdom, are all identical.

1. Express the company’s revenue as a function of the quantity of cocoa it purchases, transports, and sells.

2. Express the company’s costs as a function of the quantity of cocoa it purchases, transports, and sells.

3. Express the company’s profits as a function of the quantity of cocoa it purchases, transports, and sells.

4. Assuming that $\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma > 0$, find the break-even quantity (or quantities) of cocoa trade for this company. 

5. Identify the range (or ranges) of cocoa trade that will earn the company strictly positive and strictly negative profits. 

6. How would your answer to the preceding part of this question change if $\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma \leq 0$?
