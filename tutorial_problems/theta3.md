The demand for a product, $D$, depends on the price $p$ of the product and on the price $q$ charged by a competing producer.  It is $D(p, q) = a - bpq^{-\alpha}$, where $a, b$ and $\alpha$ are positive constants with $\alpha < 1$.

Find $D'_p(p, q)$ and $D'_q(p, q)$, and comment on the signs of the partial derivatives.
