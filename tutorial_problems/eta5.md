It is a linear version of a three market Marshallian Cross model.

Assuming that all three markets are in equilibrium, solve the following system of linear equations.


$$
\left\{\begin{array}{cccccc}
Q^D_1 & = & 50 - 2P_1 + 5P_2 - 3P_3 & & & \cdots(D1) \\
Q^S_1 & = & 8P_1 - 5 & & & \cdots(S1) \\
Q^D_1 & = & Q^S_1 & = & Q_1 & \cdots(E1) \\
Q^D_2 & = & 22 + 7P_1 - 2P_2 + 5P_3 & & & \cdots(D2) \\
Q^S_2 & = & 12P_2 - 5 & & & \cdots(S2) \\
Q^D_2 & = & Q^S_2 & = & Q_2 & \cdots(E2) \\
Q^D_3 & = & 17 + P_1 + 5P_2 - 3P_3 & & & \cdots(D3) \\
Q^S_3 & = & 4P_3 - 1 & & & \cdots(S3) \\
Q^D_3 & = & Q^S_3 & = & Q_3 & \cdots(E3) \\
\end{array}\right\} .

Hint: There are two ways that you might proceed here. 

You could use the equilibrium (market clearing) conditions for the three markets to construct a system of six linear equations in six unknown variables. In this approach, the unknown variables are the three equilibrium quantities $\left(Q_{1}, Q_{2}\right.$ and $\left.Q_{3}\right)$ and the three equilibrium prices $\left(P_{1}, P_{2}\right.$ and $P_{3}$ ). 

Alternatively, you could use use the equilibrium (market clearing) conditions for the three markets to construct a system of three linear equations in three unknown variables. In this case, the unknown variables are the three equilibrium prices $\left(P_{1}, P_{2}\right.$ and $\left.P_{3}\right)$.
If you employ this approach, you will need to use some of the original equations and the equilibrium values for the prices to obtain the three equilibrium quantities $\left(Q_{1}, Q_{2}\right.$ and $\left.Q_{3}\right)$.
