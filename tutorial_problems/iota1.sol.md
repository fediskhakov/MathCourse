**2(a)**

The utility function is

$$
U(x, y)=U(x, y)=x^{0.5} y^{0.5}=\sqrt{x} \sqrt{y}=\sqrt{x y}
$$

The indifference curve corresponding to an amount of utility equal to 40 "utils" is given by the condition

$$
U(x, y)=40 \Longleftrightarrow \sqrt{x y}=40 \Longleftrightarrow x y=1,600 \Longleftrightarrow y=\frac{1,600}{x}
$$

Thus the equation of the indifference curve corresponding to an amount of utility equal to 40 "utils" is

$$
y=\frac{1,600}{x}
$$

Note that the graph of this indifference curve will be a rectangular hyperbola.




**2(b)**

The slope of the indifference curve corresponding to an amount of utility equal to 40 "utils" is given by

$$
\frac{d y}{d x}=\frac{d}{d x}\left(\frac{1,600}{x}\right)=\frac{d}{d x} 1,600 x^{-1}=-1,600 x^{-2}=-\left(\frac{1,600}{x^{2}}\right)
$$

We can show that the marginal rate of substitution of $x$ for $y$ for this utility function is given by

$$
M R S_{x, y}(x, y)=\frac{y}{x}
$$

(Exercise: Show this.) At first glance, it might appear that

$$
\frac{d y}{d x} \neq-M R S_{x, y}(x, y)
$$

in this case (when $U=40$ ). Oh ye of little faith! Recall that the equation for the indifference curve corresponding to a utility level of forty "utils" was

$$
y=\frac{1,600}{x}
$$

Upon substituting this into the marginal rate of substitution expression, we obtain

$$
M R S_{x, y}(x, y)=\frac{y}{x}=\frac{\left(\frac{1,600}{x}\right)}{x}=\frac{1,600}{x^{2}}
$$

so that we do indeed have

$$
\frac{d y}{d x}=\frac{1,600}{x^{2}}=-M R S_{x, y}(x, y)
$$

**2(c)**

The utility function is

$$
U(x, y)=U(x, y)=x^{0.5} y^{0.5}=\sqrt{x} \sqrt{y}=\sqrt{x y}
$$

The indifference curve corresponding to an arbitrary, but given, amount of utility, say $k>0$, is given by the condition

$$
U(x, y)=k \Longleftrightarrow \sqrt{x y}=k \Longleftrightarrow x y=k^{2} \Longleftrightarrow y=\frac{k^{2}}{x}
$$

Thus the equation of the indifference curve corresponding to a utility level of $k>0$ is

$$
y=\frac{k^{2}}{x}
$$

Note that the graph of any such indifference curve (when the utility level is $k>0$ ) will be a rectangular hyperbola.

**2(d)**

The slope of the indifference curve corresponding to a utility level of $k>0$ is given by

$$
\frac{d y}{d x}=\frac{d}{d x}\left(\frac{k^{2}}{x}\right)=\frac{d}{d x} k^{2} x^{-1}=-k^{2} x^{-2}=-\left(\frac{k^{2}}{x^{2}}\right)
$$

We can show that the marginal rate of substitution of $x$ for $y$ for this utility function is given by

$$
M R S_{x, y}(x, y)=\frac{y}{x}
$$

(Exercise: Show this.) At first glance, it might appear that

$$
\frac{d y}{d x} \neq-M R S_{x, y}(x, y)
$$

in this case (when $U=k>0$ ). Oh ye of little faith! Recall that the equation for the indifference curve corresponding to a utility level of $k>0$ was

$$
y=\frac{k^{2}}{x}
$$

Upon substituting this into the marginal rate of substitution expression, we obtain

$$
M R S_{x, y}(x, y)=\frac{y}{x}=\frac{\left(\frac{k^{2}}{x}\right)}{x}=\frac{k^{2}}{x^{2}}
$$

so that we do indeed have

$$
\frac{d y}{d x}=\frac{k^{2}}{x^{2}}=-M R S_{x, y}(x, y)
$$
