Find the following integrals:

(a) $\displaystyle \int \frac{(y - 2)^2}{\sqrt{y}} \mathop{dy}$

(b) $\displaystyle \int \frac{x^3}{x + 1} \mathop{dx}$

(c) $\displaystyle \int x(1 + x^2)^{15} \mathop{dx}$

Hints: 
- In part (a), first expand $(y - 2)^2$, and then divide each term by $\sqrt{y}$
- In part (b), note that $x^3 = x^2 - x +1 -\frac{1}{x+1}$ (this is polynomial division as in Section 4.7 of SHSC)
- In part (c), what is the derivative of $(1 + x^2)^{16}$?
