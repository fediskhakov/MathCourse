### Part 1
The company is a monopolist in the United Kingdom cocoa market. As
such, it realises that the quantity that it sells will influence the price per
unit that it receives because of the downward sloping inverse demand curve
for cocoa in the United Kingdom. As such, the company's revenue is given
by

$$
R(Q) = P_{UK}(Q)Q =
\left(\alpha_1 - \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)Q \right)Q = \alpha_1 Q - \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) Q^2
$$


### Part 2
The company's costs consist of both the cost of purchasing the cocoa in
Ghana and the cost of transporting the cocoa from Ghana to the United
Kingdom. Since the company is a monopsonist in the Ghana cocoa market,
it realises that the quantity of cocoa that it purchases will influence the price
per unit that it must pay because of the upward sloping inverse supply curve
for cocoa in Ghana. As such, the company's revenue is given by

$$
\begin{array}{l}
C(Q) = P_{Ghana}(Q)Q + \gamma Q \\
= \left(\alpha_2 + \frac{1}{6}Q \right)Q + \gamma Q \\
= \alpha_2 Q + \frac{1}{6}Q^2 + \gamma Q \\
= (\alpha_2 + \gamma) Q + \frac{1}{6}Q^2.
\end{array}
$$


### Part 3
The company's profit is simply the difference between its revenue and its
costs. As such, its profit is given by

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\Pi(Q) = R(Q) - C(Q) \\
= \alpha_1 Q - \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) Q^2 - \left\{(\alpha_2 + \gamma) Q + \left(\frac{1}{6}\right) Q^2\right\} \\
= \alpha_1 Q - \left(\frac{2}{6}\right) Q^2 - (\alpha_2 + \gamma) Q - \left(\frac{1}{6}\right) Q^2 \\
= \left\{\alpha_1 - (\alpha_2 + \gamma)\right\} - \left(\frac{3}{6}\right) Q^2 \\
= (\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma) Q - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)Q^2.
\end{array}
$$



### Part 4
Note that the company's profit is a quadratic function of $Q$ with a negative
coefficient on the quadratic term. This means that the graph of its profit
function will be an "upside-down", or hill-shaped, parabola. By definition,
the company will break-even when its profit is precisely equal to zero. This
requires that

$$
\Pi(Q) = 0 \Longleftrightarrow (\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma) Q - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)Q^2 = 0 \\
\Longleftrightarrow -\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)Q^2 + (\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma) Q + 0 = 0.
$$

This is a quadratic equation in $Q$ with the coefficients $a = -(\frac{1}{2}), b = (\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma)$, and $c = 0$. We can solve it by using the quadratic formula. Upon doing this, we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{l}
Q_1, Q_2 = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\
= \frac{-(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma) \pm \sqrt{(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma)^2 - 4\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(0)}}{2\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)} \\
= \frac{-(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma) \pm \sqrt{(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma)^2 - 0}}{-1} \\
= (\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma) \mp \sqrt{(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma)^2} \\
= (\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma) \mp (\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma) \\
= 0, 2(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma).
\end{array}
$$



### Part 5

Note that when $(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma) > 0$, we have $Q_2 = 2(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma) > 0$. Since the profit function is an upside-down parabola, we know in this case
that:

- $\Pi < 0$ when $Q < 0$ or $Q > 2(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma)$,
- $\Pi = 0$ when $Q = 0$ or $Q = 2(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma)$, and
- $\Pi > 0$ if $0 < Q < 2(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma)$.

Finally, note that $Q < 0$ does not really make any sense in the economic
context of this question. A negative choice of $Q$ might be interpreted
as the company purchasing cocoa in the United Kingdom, shipping it to
Ghana and selling it in Ghana. But we are not told that the cocoa supply
function in Ghana becomes the Cocoa demand function in Ghana when
$Q < 0$, nor are we told that the cocoa demand function in the United
Kingdom becomes the cocoa supply function in the United Kingdom when
$Q < 0$, nor are we told that the cost of transporting cocoa from Ghana to
the United Kingdom is identical to the cost of shipping it from the United
Kingdom to Ghana.



### Part 6
Suppose that $(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma) \leq 0$. Let us divide this case into two distinct sub-cases: (i) $(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma) = 0$, and (ii) $(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma) < 0$.

First, consider the case in which $(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma) = 0$. In this case, there is a single, repeated root, so that the unique distinct solution to the break-even equation is $Q_1 = Q_2 = 0$. In this case, the firm can never earn a positive profit. It will earn a profit of precisely zero (that is, it will break even) when $Q = 0$. Any other value for $Q$ will yield a negative profit.

Now consider the case in which $(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma) < 0$. In this case, we once again have two distinct roots. These are the same roots that we found earlier: $Q_1 = 0$ and $Q_2 = 2(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma)$. Note that in this case, however, we have $Q_2 = 2 (\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma) < 0$. Since the profit function is an upside-down parabola, we know in this case that:
- $\Pi < 0$ when $Q < 2 (\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma)$ or $Q > 0$,
- $\Pi = 0$ when $Q = 2 (\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma)$ or $Q = 0$, and
- $\Pi > 0$ if $2 (\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 - \gamma) < Q < 0$.

Finally, note once again that $Q < 0$ does not really make any sense in the economic context of this question. A negative choice of $Q$ might be interpreted
as the company purchasing cocoa in the United Kingdom, shipping it to
Ghana and selling it in Ghana. But we are not told that the cocoa supply
function in Ghana becomes the Cocoa demand function in Ghana when
$Q < 0$, nor are we told that the cocoa demand function in the United
Kingdom becomes the cocoa supply function in the United Kingdom when
$Q < 0$, nor are we told that the cost of transporting cocoa from Ghana to
the United Kingdom is identical to the cost of shipping it from the United
Kingdom to Ghana.
