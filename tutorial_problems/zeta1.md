Find the Taylor series expansion (that is, infinite-order approximation) of the function $f(x)=e^{\frac{x}{2}}$ around the point $x=2$, and use it to obtain a cubic approximation of this function. 

What is the remainder term that reconciles the cubic approximation of the function based on its Taylor series expansion and the true value of the function?
