Part (a)

1. The set $F \cap B \cap C$ is the set of female biology students at that university who are part of the university choir.
2. The set $M \cap F$ is the set of female mathematics students at that university.
3. $(M \cap B) \setminus C$ is the set of students at the university that study both mathematics and biology but are not in the choir. 
4. $((M \cap B) \setminus C) \setminus T$ is the set of students at the university that study both mathematics and biology but neither participate in the university choir nor play tennis. 

Part (b)

1. If all biology students were also mathematics students, then we would have $B \subseteq M$.

2. If there are some female biology students that participate in the university choir, then $F \cap B \cap C \neq \emptyset$.

3. If there are no tennis players that study biology, then $T \cap B = \emptyset$.

4. If all female students that neither play tennis nor participate in the university choir study biology, then $F \setminus (T \cup C) \subseteq B$.
