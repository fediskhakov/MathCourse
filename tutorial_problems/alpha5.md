One thousand people took part in a survey to reveal which newspaper ($A$, $B$, or $C$) that had read on a (common) specified day. The responses showed that 420 had read $A$, 316 had read $B$, and 160 had read $C$. These figures include 116 who had read both $A$ and $B$, 100 who had read both $A$ and $C$, and 30 who had read both $B$ and $C$. Finally, all of these figures include 16 who had read all three papers.

1. How many respondents to the survey had read $A$ but not $B$?
2. How many respondents to the survey had read $C$, but neither $A$ nor $B$?
3. How many respondents to the survey had read neither $A$ nor $B$ nor $C$?
