The B-Happy corporation runs a lottery with a prize of $\$ 1,000,000$. The winners are given the following options. They can receive the prize of $\$ 1,000,000$ immediately, or they can receive a payment of $\$ 140,000$ every year for the next ten years. The nominal interest rate that is used to discount future receipts is $i=8 \%$ per annum.

(a) What is the future value of $\$ 1,000,000$ in ten years time if interest is compounded yearly?

(b) What is the future value of the regular yearly payments of $\$ 140,000$ made at the end of each of the next ten years if interest is compounded yearly?

(c) Which option should a winner of the lottery choose?

(d) Which option should the winner choose if the payments of $\$ 140,000$ are made at the start, rather than at the end, of each year?

(e) Explain what happens in parts (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this question if interest is compounded continuously instead of yearly, but payments are still made yearly.
