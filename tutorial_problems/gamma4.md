**A.**

Consider the Cobb-Douglas utility function, $U(x, y) = x^{\alpha} y^{1-\alpha}$. 

We will assume that $0 < \alpha < 1$. Assuming that $x > 0$ and $y > 0$, calculate $\ln(U(x, y))$. 

Why did we need to assume that $x > 0$ and $y > 0$? 

Calculate $\exp(\ln(U(x, y)))$. 

What, if anything, do you notice?


**B.**

Now Consider the Stone-Geary utility function,
$U(x, y) = (x - \beta)^{\alpha} (y - \gamma)^{1-\alpha}$.

We will assume that $0 < \alpha < 1$, $\beta \geq 0$, and $\gamma \geq 0$. 

Assuming that $x > \beta$ and $y > \gamma$, calculate $\ln(U(x,y))$. 

Why did we need to assume that $x > \beta$ and $y > \gamma$? 

Calculate $\exp(\ln(U(x, y)))$. 

What, if anything, do you notice?

**C.**

Is the Cobb-Douglas utility function a special case of the Stone-Geary utility function? Explain your answer.
