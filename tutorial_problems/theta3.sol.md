The partial derivatives are as follows:

$$
D'_p(p, q) = -bq^{-\alpha} < 0
\quad\quad\quad
D'_q(p, q) = \alpha bpq^{-\alpha - 1} > 0
$$

$D'_p(p, q) < 0$ implies that as the price $p$ increases, the demand $D$ will decrease, *ceteris paribus*.

$D'_q(p, q) > 0$ implies that as the competing producer's price $q$ increases, the demand $D$ will increase, *ceteris paribus*.
