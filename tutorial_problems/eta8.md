This question is an example of the IS-LM macroeconomic model of an economy. The ISLM model consists of two equations. The first equation is the IS equation. It describes the locus of equilibrium points in the goods market. The "IS" term comes from one version of the goods market equilibrium condition, in which investment ($I$) must equal savings $(S)$. The second equation is the LM equation. It describes the locus of equilibrium points in the money market. The "LM" term comes from the money market equilibrium condition, in which money demand ($L$) must equal money supply ($M$). The letter $L$ stands for liquidity preference, which is one potential source of the demand for money. Note that there is implicitly a third market in this model. This is the bond market. It does not need to be formally considered because Walras' law ensures that if all but one of the markets in an economy clear, then the remaining market will also clear.

The bond market is implicitly present because there is an opportunity cost involved with holding money balances. This opportunity cost takes the form of the foregone interest which could have been earned if those money balances had been used to purchase bonds. If both the goods market and the money market are simultaneously in equilibrium, then the economy as a whole is in "general equilibrium". (Further information on the IS-LM model at the intermediate (second year undergraduate) level can be found in Levacic and Rebman (1982), Parkin and Bade (1990), and Wells (1995).)

Assuming that the economy is in a situation of general equilibrium, obtain the equations for the IS curve and LM curve from the equations below and use Cramer's rule to solve that system of two linear equations in two unknowns to find the equilibrium values of $Y$ and $r$. The equations underlying this model are:

Goods Market: 

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{cccc}
Y^{D} & = & C+I & \cdots(G D) \\ 
C & = & 237.8+0.2 Y & \cdots(C D) \\ 
I & = & 10-0.4 r & \cdots(I D) \\ 
Y^{S} & = & Y & \text { (Keynesian GS) } \\ 
Y^{D} & = & Y^{S} & \text { (GMEquil) }
\end{array}\right\} \text{; and}
$$

Money Market: 

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{cccc}
M^{D} & = & 100+0.1 Y-0.3 r & \cdots(M D) \\ 
M^{S} & = & 129.225 & (M S) \\ 
M^{D} & = & M^{S} & (M M E q u i l)
\end{array}\right\}.
$$
