It appears to be part of an application of a linear version of a three market Marshallian cross model.

Solve the following system of linear equations:

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{ccccc}
P_{1}+4 P_{2}+8 P_{3} & = &26 & \cdots & (\text { Equation } 1) \\
5 P_{1}+7 P_{2} & = &38 & \cdots & (\text { Equation } 2) \\
8 P_{1}+12 P_{2}+2 P_{3} & = & 66 & \cdots & (\text { Equation } 3)
\end{array}\right\} .
$$
