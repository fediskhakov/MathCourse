The firm’s (short-run) cost function is
$C(Q) = F + V(Q) = 95,000 + (2.20)Q$.

The firm’s revenue function is
$R(Q) = pQ = 3Q$.

The firm’s profit function is
$\Pi(Q) = R(Q) - C(Q) = 3Q - (95,000 + (2.20)Q)$
$= $3Q - 95,000 - (2.20)Q = (0.80)Q - 95,000$.

Clearly the firm’s profit is a linear (or an
affine) function of its output.

The break-even point is given by zero profit, thus we have to solve
$\Pi(Q) = 0$. 
Solution is $Q = 95,000 / 0.80 = 118,750$ units.
