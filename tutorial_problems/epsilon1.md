Consider the function

$$
f(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{l}
\frac{1}{x-1} \text { if } x \neq 1 \\
0 \text { if } x=1
\end{array}\right.
$$

(a) Does $\lim _{x \rightarrow 5} f(x)$ exist? If so, what is it? Try and establish the validity of your answer formally using an epsilon-delta argument. If it exists, does it equal $f(5)$ ? Is this function continuous at the point $x=5$ ?

(b) Does $\lim _{x \rightarrow 1} f(x)$ exist? If so, what is it? Try and establish the validity of your answer formally using an epsilon-delta argument. If it exists, does it equal $f(1)$ ? Is this function continuous at the point $x=1$ ?

(c) Is this function continuous?
