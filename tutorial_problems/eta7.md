Employ Gauss-Jordan elimination to determine the possible solutions of the following system of linear equations for different values of $a$ and
$b$ :

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{ccccc}
x+y-z & = & 1 & \cdots & (\text { Equation } 1) \\
x-y+2 z & = & 2 & \cdots & (\text { Equation } 2) \\
x+2 y-a z & = & b & \cdots & (\text { Equation } 3)
\end{array}\right\} .
$$
