*Cobb-Douglas Preferences Specific Example*: 

Consider the utility function $U(x, y)=x^{0.5} y^{0.5}$ that is defined on the consumption set $\mathbb{R}_{+}^{2}$.

(a) Find the equation of the indifference curve that corresponds to $U=40$.

(b) What is the slope of the indifference curve for $U=40$ for any given value of $x$?

(c) What is the equation of an arbitrary indifference curve for this utility function?

(d) What is the slope of an arbitrary indifference curve for this utility function at any given value of $x$?
