- An indifference curve is a level-set for the utility function. Every consumption bundle on an indifference curve must generate the same level of utility. Thus the equation that describes a representative indifference curve is $U\left(q_{1}, q_{2}\right)=k$, where $k$ is a constant.
- Along any indifference curve, utility is constant. Thus if we imagine varying $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ while stating on an indifference curve, we must have no change in the utility level $(d k=0)$.
- A first-order differential approximation to the change in utility that is induced by varying $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ is given by $d U \approx\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial q_{1}}\right) d q_{1}+\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial q_{2}}\right) d q_{2}=$ $M U_{1} d q_{1}+M U_{2} d q_{2}$.
- Thus at any point on an indifference curve, we must have $M U_{1} d q_{1}+$ $M U_{2} d q_{2} \approx 0$.
- Rearranging this equation, we obtain

$$
\text { Slope of IC }=\left(\frac{d q_{2}}{d q_{1}}\right)_{d U=0} \approx-\left(\frac{M U_{1}}{M U_{2}}\right)=-M R S_{1,2}
$$
