According to a study of industrial fishing, the annual herring catch is given by the production function $Y(K, S) = 0.06157 K^{1.356} S^{0.562}$ involving the catching effort $K$ and the herring stock $S$.

(a) Find $\frac{\partial Y}{\partial K}$ and $\frac{\partial Y}{\partial S}$.

(b) If K and S are both doubled, what happens to the catch?
