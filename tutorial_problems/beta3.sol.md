Note that $f(x)$ will be defined whenever the denominator $(x-2)$ does not equal zero.Thus the only restriction on the domain of this function is that $x \ne 2$. Therefore the domain for this function is the set $D = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : x \ne 2\} = \mathbb{R} \setminus \{2\}$.

Suppose that $f(x) = 5$. This requires that $f^{-1}(5)$ is defined: 

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\frac{3x+6}{x-2} = 5 \\
3x+6 = 5(x-2) \\
6+10 = 5x-3x \\
x = 8
\end{array}
$$

Thus, for $x=8$ $f(x) = 5$ and therefore $5$ belongs to the range of $f$.

Suppose instead that f(x) = 3. This requires that

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\frac{3x+6}{x-2} = 3 \\
3x+6 = 3(x-2) \\
6+6 = 3x-3x \\
12 = 0
\end{array}
$$

This equation does not have any solutions. Therefore, $f^{-1}(3)$ is undefined, and so $3$ does not belong to the range of $f$.
