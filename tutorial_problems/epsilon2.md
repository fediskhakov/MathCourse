Consider the function

$$
f(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{l}
x^{2} \text { if } x \neq 0 \\
-50 \text { if } x=0
\end{array}\right.
$$

(a) Does $\lim _{x \rightarrow 0} f(x)$ exist? If so, what is it? Try and establish the validity of your answer formally using an epsilon-delta argument. If it exists, does it equal $f(0)$ ? Is this function continuous at the point $x=0$ ?

(b) Is this function continuous?
