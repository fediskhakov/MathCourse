- immediate feedback
- each assignment is worth 10% of your raw overall mark for this course
- no late submissions will be accepted
- not submitted by the due date --- mark of zero
- **will include material from the two lectures and tutorials prior to the test**

``
Computerized quizzes are located at the course Wattle page
``

### Final exam, 50%

- **Covers the material from the whole semester!**
- More information will be provided in Week 10, with practice examples discussed prior to the exam
- Will be held during the examination period May 30 to June 16


## Note on lectures notes

- Cover exactly what you are required to know
- Code inserts are the exception, they are not assessable

In particular, you need to know:
- The `definitions` from the notes
- The `facts` from the notes
- How to apply facts and definitions

If a concept in not in the lecture notes, it is not assessable

## Reading materials

1. **Primary reference:** lecture notes

2. ***Essential mathematics for economic analysis (fifth edition)***  
by Sydsæter, Hammond, Strøm and Carvajal

{cite:ps}`sydsaeter2016`:

```{figure} _static/img/bibliography/shsc2016.png
:height: 300 px
:align: center
```

- each lecture will reference book chapters in **Sydsæter et.al., 2016**
- each lecture will give additional references for self-study

## How tutorials will be conducted?

- practical exercises 
- posted with the corresponding lecture
- try to solve the exercises before the tutorial
- exercises solved and discussed at the tutorial
- **participation is highly recommended**
- **if you solve all tutorial excesses, you will be able to solve all practical problems in the exams**
- solutions to selected problems posted a week after

**Tutorials start on week 2**

## Where to send your questions

1. Administrative questions: RSE admin

    - **Bronwyn Cammack** Senior School Administrator
    - Email: enquiries.rse@anu.edu.au
    - *"I can not register for the tutorial group"*

2. Content related questions: please, refer to the tutors

    - *"I don't understand why this function is convex"*

3. Other questions: to Fedor

    - *"I'm working hard but still can not keep up"*
    - *"Can I please have extra exercises for more practice"*

## Attendance

- please, **do not** use email for *instructional* questions
- instead make use of the office hours

- attendance of tutorials is *very highly* recommended\
You will make your life much easier this way

- attendance of lectures is *highly* recommended\
