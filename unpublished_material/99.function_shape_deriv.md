# Using first and second derivatives to investigate the shape of a function

- The first and second order derivatives of a function provide useful information about the shape of that function.
- The first derivative tells us about the slope of a function. Is it increasing, decreasing, or constant over some interval? At what point or points, if any, does the sign of the slope of the function change? (Such points are known as turning points.)
- The second derivative tells us about the curvature of the function. Is it convex or concave over some interval? At what point or points, if any, does the curvature of the function change? (Such points are known as inflexion points.)

A **turning point** of a function $f(x)$ is such $x$ where the function changes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa.

An **inflexion point** of a function $f(x)$ is such $x$ where the curvature of the function changes from convex to concave or vice versa.

## Increasing functions

```{admonition} Definition
:class: caution

A function is said to be **increasing** on the non-empty interval $(a, b) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ if $f\left(x_{0}\right) \leqslant f\left(x_{1}\right)$ whenever $x_{0}<x_{1}$, where $x_{0} \in(a, b)$ and $x_{1} \in(a, b)$.

A function is said to be **strictly increasing** on the non-empty interval $(a, b) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ if $f\left(x_{0}\right)<f\left(x_{1}\right)$ whenever $x_{0}<x_{1}$, where $x_{0} \in(a, b)$ and $x_{1} \in(a, b)$.

```{admonition} Fact
:class: important

If $f^{\prime}(x) \geqslant 0$ for all $x \in(a, b)$, then the function $f(x)$ is increasing on the interval $(a, b)$.

If $f^{\prime}(x)>0$ for all $x \in(a, b)$, then the function $f(x)$ is strictly increasing on the interval $(a, b)$.

## Decreasing functions

- A function is said to be **decreasing** on the non-empty interval $(a, b) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ if $f\left(x_{0}\right) \geqslant f\left(x_{1}\right)$ whenever $x_{0}<x_{1}$, where $x_{0} \in(a, b)$ and $x_{1} \in(a, b)$.
    - If $f^{\prime}(x) \leqslant 0$ for all $x \in(a, b)$, then the function $f(x)$ is decreasing on the interval $(a, b)$.
- A function is said to be **strictly decreasing** on the non-empty interval $(a, b) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ if $f\left(x_{0}\right)>f\left(x_{1}\right)$ whenever $x_{0}<x_{1}$, where $x_{0} \in(a, b)$ and $x_{1} \in(a, b)$.
    - If $f^{\prime}(x)<0$ for all $x \in(a, b)$, then the function $f(x)$ is strictly decreasing on the interval $(a, b)$.


## Convex functions

- A function is said to be **convex** on the non-empty interval $(a, b) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ if $f\left(\lambda x_{0}+(1-\lambda) x_{1}\right) \leqslant \lambda f\left(x_{0}\right)+(1-\lambda) f\left(x_{1}\right)$ whenever $x_{0} \in(a, b), x_{1} \in(a, b)$ and $x_{0} \neq x_{1}$.
    - In other words, a function is convex on an interval if the graph of the straight line joining any two distinct points in that interval lies on or above the graph of the function between those two points.
    - If $f^{\prime \prime}(x) \geqslant 0$ for all $x \in(a, b)$, then the function $f(x)$ is convex on the interval $(a, b)$.
- A function is said to be **strictly convex** on the non-empty interval $(a, b) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ if $f\left(\lambda x_{0}+(1-\lambda) x_{1}\right)<\lambda f\left(x_{0}\right)+(1-\lambda) f\left(x_{1}\right)$ whenever $x_{0} \in(a, b), x_{1} \in(a, b)$ and $x_{0} \neq x_{1}$.
    - In other words, a function is strictly convex on an interval if the graph of the straight line joining any two distinct points in that interval lies strictly above the graph of the function between those two points.
    - If $f^{\prime \prime}(x)>0$ for all $x \in(a, b)$, then the function $f(x)$ is strictly convex on the interval $(a, b)$.


## Concave functions

- A function is said to be **concave** on the non-empty interval $(a, b) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ if $f\left(\lambda x_{0}+(1-\lambda) x_{1}\right) \geqslant \lambda f\left(x_{0}\right)+(1-\lambda) f\left(x_{1}\right)$ whenever $x_{0} \in(a, b), x_{1} \in(a, b)$ and $x_{0} \neq x_{1}$.
    - In other words, a function is concave on an interval if the graph of the straight line joining any two distinct points in that interval lies on or below the graph of the function between those two points.
    - If $f^{\prime \prime}(x) \leqslant 0$ for all $x \in(a, b)$, then the function $f(x)$ is convex on the interval $(a, b)$.
- A function is said to be **strictly concave** on the non-empty interval $(a, b) \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ if $f\left(\lambda x_{0}+(1-\lambda) x_{1}\right)>\lambda f\left(x_{0}\right)+(1-\lambda) f\left(x_{1}\right)$ whenever $x_{0} \in(a, b), x_{1} \in(a, b)$ and $x_{0} \neq x_{1}$.
    - In other words, a function is strictly concave on an interval if the graph of the straight line joining any two distinct points in that interval lies strictly below the graph of the function between those two points.
    - If $f^{\prime \prime}(x)<0$ for all $x \in(a, b)$, then the function $f(x)$ is strictly convex on the interval $(a, b)$.


## Peak (local maximum) turning points

- The point $c$ yields a **local maximum** of the function $f(x)$ if there exists some non-empty interval $(a, b)$ that is a subset of the domain of the function such that $c \in(a, b)$ and $f(x) \leqslant f(c)$ for all $x \in(a, b)$.
- If (i) $f^{\prime}(c)=0$, (ii) $f^{\prime}(x) \geqslant 0$ for all $x \in(a, c)$ where $a<c$, and (iii) $f^{\prime}(x) \leqslant 0$ for all $x \in(c, b)$ where $c<b$, then the point $x=c$ yields a local maximum of the function $f$ over the non-empty interval $(a, b)$.
- If (i) $f^{\prime}(c)=0$ and (ii) $f^{\prime \prime}(c)<0$, then the point $x=c$ yields a strict local maximum of the function $f$ over some non-empty interval $(a, b)$ such that $c \in(a, b)$.
    - Note that we need $f^{\prime \prime}(c)<0$ here. If $f^{\prime \prime}(c)=0$, then this theorem does not apply. In such a case, a different approach must be used to determine whether or not the point $x=c$ yields a local maximum of the function.


## Trough (local minimum) turning points

- The point $c$ yields a **local minimum** of the function $f(x)$ if there exists some non-empty interval $(a, b)$ that is a subset of the domain of the function such that $c \in(a, b)$ and $f(x) \geqslant f(c)$ for all $x \in(a, b)$.
- If (i) $f^{\prime}(c)=0$, (ii) $f^{\prime}(x) \leqslant 0$ for all $x \in(a, c)$ where $a<c$, and (iii) $f^{\prime}(x) \geqslant 0$ for all $x \in(c, b)$ where $c<b$, then the point $x=c$ yields a local minimum of the function $f$ over the non-empty interval $(a, b)$.
- If (i) $f^{\prime}(c)=0$ and (ii) $f^{\prime \prime}(c)>0$, then the point $x=c$ yields a strict local minimum of the function $f$ over some non-empty interval $(a, b)$ such that $c \in(a, b)$.
    - Note that we need $f^{\prime \prime}(c)>0$ here. If $f^{\prime \prime}(c)=0$, then this theorem does not apply. In such a case, a different approach must be used to determine whether or not the point $x=c$ yields a local minimum of the function.


## Inflection points

- An **inflection point** of a function is a point at which the curvature of the function changes from either convex to concave or concave to convex.
- The point $x=c$ is an inflection point of the twice differentiable function $f(x)$ if there exists some interval $(a, b)$ that is a subset of the domain of $f(x)$ such that $c \in(a, b)$ and either (a) both (i) $f^{\prime \prime}(x) \geqslant 0$ for all $x \in(a, c)$ and (ii) $f^{\prime \prime}(x) \leqslant 0$ for all $x \in(c, b)$, or (b) both (i) $f^{\prime \prime}(x) \leqslant 0$ for all $x \in(a, c)$ and (ii) $f^{\prime \prime}(x) \geqslant 0$ for all $x \in(c, b)$.


- Suppose that the function $f(x)$ is twice continuously differentiable on the interval $(a, b)$, where that interval is a subset of the domain of the function. If $c \in(a, b)$ is an inflection point of the function $f(x)$, then $f^{\prime \prime}(c)=0$.
- Suppose that the function $f(x)$ is twice continuously differentiable on the interval $(a, b)$, where that interval is a subset of the domain of the function and $c \in(a, b)$. If both (i) $f^{\prime \prime}(c)=0$ and (ii) $f^{\prime \prime}(c)$ changes sign at the point $x=c$, then the point $x=c$ is an inflection point of the function $f(x)$.
