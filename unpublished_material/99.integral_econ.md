## Marginal private benefit and demand

The marginal benefit of an additional unit of a good to you is the maximum amount that you would pay for that additional unit, given your consumption level of the good without the additional unit

The marginal private benefit schedule for a good is a function of the form $M B(Q$; other $)$, where $Q$ is the quantity of the good that is consumed, other is the values that are taken by a set of other factors that affect the marginal benefit of the good in question and $M B$ ( $Q$; other) is the benefit that the consumer receives from the last of the $Q$ units of the good that he consumed

As a matter of convenience, we will often write $M B(Q ;$ other $)$ as simply $M B(Q)$


### Diminishing marginal benefits

We will assume that the marginal private benefit schedule displays diminishing marginal returns. In other words, holding the values of the things that are in other fixed, the benefit from consuming a further unit of the good (that is, the marginal benefit) will decrease as $Q$ increases. This means that the marginal private benefit schedule for a good will be downward sloping in $(Q, P)$-space


### Discrete MB schedule example

This example comes from {cite:ps}`alchian1983` (p. 43, Question 43)

Suppose that only integer (whole number) amounts of a particular good (call it $X$ ) may be consumed. The marginal benefit schedule for good $X$ is given by the following table

| $\mathbf{Q}$ | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $\mathbf{M B}$ | $\$ 10$ | $\$ 9$ | $\$ 8$ | $\$ 7$ | $\$ 6$ | $\$ 5$ | $\$ 4$ | $\$ 3$ | $\$ 2$ | $\$ 1$ |


The following diagram is the graph of this marginal private benefit schedule

### Linear MB schedule example

Suppose that the marginal private benefit schedule is given by the equation $M P B=20-4 Q$

This is the equation of a straight line in $(Q, M P B)$-space with a MPB intercept equal to $\$ 20$ and a slope equal to $( -4 ) (\$/\text{Unit})$
The diagram below is a graph of this marginal private benefit schedule

```

### Non-Linear MB schedule example

Suppose that the marginal private benefit schedule is given by the equation

$$
M P B=\frac{100}{(Q+1)}
$$

This is the equation of a rectangular hyperbola in $(Q, M P B)$-space (or, more accurately, in $(Q+1, M P B)$-space)

The diagram below is a graph of this marginal private benefit schedule

## Marginal benefit and demand

A MPB schedule tells us how much an individual benefits from an additional unit of a good or service. This is, effectively, the maximum amount that the individual would be willing to pay for that additional unit

A demand schedule tells us how many units of an item a consumer would be willing to purchase at a particular price. Clearly, a consumer will only choose to purchase an additional unit of a good if the MPB from that unit either matches or exceeds the price that must be paid for that unit

Since the MPB schedule is downward sloping in $(Q, M P B)$-space, an individual will purchase all units up to the point where MPB is equal to the price


Let $P$ denote the price of the good or service. Since the last unit that is purchased will be the one for which $M P B=P$, we know that for any given price $P$, the quantity demanded will be given by the point on the MPB schedule where $M P B=P$

Thus the inverse demand schedule can be found by replacing MPB (the LHS of the equation for the MPB schedule) with the price of the commodity, $P$. This yields an equation of the form $P=M B(Q)$. Since this is the inverse demand equation, we will sometimes write this as $P=D^{-1}(Q)$. If we invert this inverse demand equation (that is, rearrange it to make $Q$ the subject), then we obtain the demand equation, $Q=D(P)$



## The Marshallian graphing convention

In economics, we employ an unusual convention for graphing demand (and supply) functions. This convention is known as the Marshallian graphing convention
- You might recall from high school mathematics that the usual convention for graphing functions of the form $y=f(x)$ is that the independent variable $(x)$ is depicted on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable $(y)$ is depicted on the vertical axis

We typically view demand functions (and supply functions) as expressing quantity demanded (or supplied) as a function of price
- As such, under the standard graphing convention, we would place price on the horizontal axis and quantity on the vertical axis
- Instead of this standard convention, economists typically place quantity on the horizontal axis and price on the vertical axis
- What might be referred to as a demand curve (or a supply curve) under the Marshallian graphing convention would really be an inverse demand curve (or inverse supply curve) under the standard graphing convention


The Marshallian convention means that, while we talk about demand curves (or supply curves), we actually draw *inverse* demand curves (or inverse supply curves). This means that you need to be careful when moving from the equation for a demand curve (or a supply curve) to the graph of that demand curve (or supply curve) if you are going to follow the Marshallian convention when graphing demand curves (or supply curves)


Suppose that we have a linear demand curve of the form

$$
Q=a-b P,
$$

where $a>0$ and $b>0$

The corresponding inverse-demand curve can be found as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{rlcc}
Q & = & a-b P \\
\Longleftrightarrow \quad Q+b P & = & a \\
\Longleftrightarrow \quad b P & = & a-Q \\
\Longleftrightarrow \quad P & = & \frac{a}{b}-\left(\frac{1}{b}\right) Q 
\end{array}
$$

Note the inverse demand curve is also linear when the demand curve itself is linear


Recall that we have a linear demand curve: of the form

$$
Q=a-b P,
$$

where $a>0$ and $b>0$

- The slope of this demand curve is equal to $(-b)$ and the $Q$-intercept is the point $(0, a)$ in $(P, Q)$-space
- It can be shown that the $P$-intercept is the point $\left(\frac{a}{b}, 0\right)$ in $(P, Q)$-space.  
- This is illustrated below using the standard mathematical convention for choice of axes

```{figure} _static/img/lecture_10/not_marshallian.png

:align: center

Drawing a linear demand curve (**not** the Marshallian convention)
```


Recall that the corresponding inverse demand curve is

$$
P=\frac{a}{b}-\left(\frac{1}{b}\right) Q
$$

where $a>0$ and $b>0$

- The slope of this demand curve is equal to $\left\{-\left(\frac{1}{b}\right)\right\}$ and the $P$-intercept is the point $\left(0, \frac{a}{b}\right)$ in $(Q, P)$-space
- It can be shown that the $P$-intercept is the point $(a, 0)$ in $(Q, P)$-space
- This is illustrated on the next page using the standard mathematical convention for choice of axes (which is equivalent to graphing the original demand curve using the Marshallian graphing convention)

## Obtaining total benefit from marginal benefits

- Suppose that an individual consumes $Q$ units of a good or service. What is the the total benefit to the individual of this level of consumption?
    - We will assume for the moment that the good or service in question can only be consumed in integer (that is, whole number) amounts
    - This is the type of situation that was depicted in the discrete MPB schedule example provided earlier in these notes
- We can find the marginal benefits for each of the units that are consumed from the individual's MPB schedule for this good or service
    - The marginal benefit of the first unit is given by $M P B(1)$, the marginal benefit of the second unit is given by $\operatorname{MPB}(2), \cdots$, and the marginal benefit of the $Q$ th unit is given by $\operatorname{MPB}(Q)$

- The total benefit that the individual obtains from consuming $Q$ units of this good or service is simply the sum over all units that are consumed of the MPB from each of those units

In other words,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{TPB}(Q) & =\sum_{q=1}^{Q} \operatorname{MPB}(q) \\
& =M P B(1)+M P B(2)+\cdots+\operatorname{MPB}(Q) 
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that this is simply the area below the MPB schedule. Since the MPB schedule coincides with the inverse demand schedule, this is also the area under the inverse demand schedule


Graphically, the total benefit associated with consuming 10 units of a good or service for the case considered in the discrete MPB schedule example provided earlier is the shaded area under the MPB schedule in the diagram below


```{figure} _static/img/lecture_10/discrete_mb.png
:width: 80%
:align: center

Total benefit (discrete MPB schedule)
```

Numerically, the total benefit for this example can be calculated as follows

$$
\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{TPB}(10) & =\sum_{q=1}^{10} \operatorname{MPB}(q) \\
& =\operatorname{MPB}(1)+\operatorname{MPB}(2)+\cdots+\operatorname{MPB}(10) \\
& =\$ 10+\$ 9+\$ 8+\$ 7+\$ 6+\$ 5+\$ 4+\$ 3+\$ 2+\$ 1 \\
& =\$ 55 
\end{aligned}
$$

Recall that when consumption must involve integer (that is, whole number) units, the relationship between total benefit and the relevant marginal private benefits is given by

$$
\operatorname{TPB}(Q)=\sum_{q=1}^{Q} \operatorname{MPB}(q)
$$

This relationship can be extended to the case where consumption does not have to be measured in integer (that is, whole number) units
In the case where consumption of infinitesimal amounts is possible, the relevant equation becomes

$$
\operatorname{TPB}(Q)=\int_{q=0}^{Q} M P B(q) d q
$$


As before, this is simply the area under the relevant MPB (or inverse demand) schedule between the points $q=0$ and $q=Q$

Graphically, the total benefits associated with consuming $Q$ units of a good or service is the shaded area under the MPB schedule in the following diagram
- While the diagram employs a linear inverse demand curve, it did not have to do so
- The same basic idea applies to non-linear inverse demand curves
- However, in non-linear cases, the area under the curve will not be equal to sum of the area of a rectangle and the area of a triangle
- Hence the need for the definite integral in the TPB formula provided earlier



In the case where the MPB (or inverse demand) schedule is linear, the total private benefit can be calculated by using some simple geometry results from high school mathematics

Suppose that the inverse demand curve for an individual is given by

$$
P=a-b q
$$

and that the individual chooses to consume $Q$ units of the good or service, where $0<Q<\frac{a}{b}$

Note that the marginal benefit from the $Q$ th unit of this good or service is simply $(a-b Q)$
The total benefit for this case is illustrated in the diagram on the following slide

```{figure} _static/img/lecture_10/linear_tpb.png
:width: 80%
:align: center

Total benefit (linear inverse demand curve)
```


In this particular example, the total private benefit from consumng $Q$ units of the good or service is equal to the sum of the area of a rectangle and the area of a triangle
- The base of the rectangle is $Q-0=Q$ units and the height of the rectangle is $(a-b Q)-0=(a-b Q) \$ /$ unit
    - As such, the area of the rectangle is $Q(a-b Q)=\left(a Q-b Q^{2}\right)$ (units)(\$/unit), which is simply $\$\left(a Q-b Q^{2}\right)$
- The base of the triangle is $Q-0=Q$ units and the perpendicular height of the triangle is $a-(a-b Q)=b Q \$ /$ unit
    - As such, the area of the triangle is $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) Q(b Q)=\frac{b Q^{2}}{2}$ (units)(\$/unit), which is simply $\$\left(\frac{b Q^{2}}{2}\right)$


This means that, in this particular example, the total private benefit from consuming $Q$ units of the good or service is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{TPB}(Q) & =\$\left(a Q-b Q^{2}\right)+\$\left(\frac{b Q^{2}}{2}\right) \\
& =\$\left(a Q-b Q^{2}+\frac{b Q^{2}}{2}\right) \\
& =\$\left(a Q-\frac{b Q^{2}}{2}\right) 
\end{aligned}
$$



## The paradox of value

The "Paradox of Value" is a term used to describe a potential confusion between marginal benefit and total benefit. It is sometimes known as the "Water-Diamond Paradox" because an example of this potential confusion that is commonly proposed concerns the value of water and the value of diamonds
- Water is needed to sustain life, while diamonds are not (or at least do not appear to be) essential for sustaining life. As such, some people might argue that water is much more valuable than diamonds
- However, the price of diamonds is very high compared to the price of water in at least some parts of the world (although the price of water might well be higher than it used to be)
- A situation in which water is much more valuable than diamonds but the price of diamonds is much higher than the price of water might appear to be somewhat paradoxical
- But this is only the case if you confuse marginal benefit with total benefit



## Consumer surplus

We have seen how to calculate the total benefit to a consumer of $Q$ units of some commodity
But in general, the consumer will need to purchase those $Q$ units
This involves giving up resources that could have been used to purchase other commodities
As such, the "net gain" to the consumer from $Q$ units of a commodity is usually smaller than the total benefit of those units to the consumer
How might we measure the "net gain" to the consumer from purchasing $Q$ units of a commodity?


Suppose that the consumer would optimally choose to purchase $Q$ units of a commodity given its current price
We want to measure how much the consumer values being allowed to purchase those $Q$ units of the commodity (given its current price)
There are two common ways of answering this question. These are the "willingness to pay" approach and the "willingness to accept" approach
- The "willingness to pay" approach attempts to identify the maximum amount that a consumer would be willing to pay in order to avoid having the right to purchase any amount of the commodity (given its current price) taken away
- The "willingness to accept" approach attempts to identify the minimum amount that the consumer would need to be paid in order to agree to the removal of the right to purchase any amount of the commodity (given its current price)



In general, the "willingness to pay" and "willingness to accept" measures of the net gain to the consumer will be different
- However, under some circumstances they will be the same
- In order to keep things relatively simple, we will assume that are the same for the moment
- We will revisit this issue later on when we discuss the compensating variation and equivalent variation concepts

The net gain to the consumer is basically equal to the difference between the total benefit that the consumer receives from purchasing $Q$ units of the commodity and the total cost to the consumer of purchasing those units
- This difference is known as the "consumer surplus" from purchasing $Q$ units of the commodity
- We have already discussed how to find the total benefit of $Q$ units of the commodity to the consumer
- But what is the total cost of these units to the consumer?


Clearly we want to find a measure of the opportunity cost of purchasing $Q$ units of the commodity
Under some circumstances, this opportunity cost will simply be equal to the expenditure that the consumer must make to purchase those $Q$ units at the current price of the commodity
Let's assume that these circumstances apply for the remainder of this discussion

Suppose that the consumer is a price taker in the market for this commodity and that the price of the commodity is $P$ per unit
Clearly the consumer's expenditure on this commodity will be $P Q$ under these circumstances
This means that the consumer surplus from purchasing $Q$ units of this commodity is given by

$$
C S(Q)=T P B(Q)-P Q=\int_{q=0}^{Q} M P B(q) d q-P Q
$$


We have shown that the consumer surplus from purchasing $Q$ units of this commodity is given by

$$
C S(Q)=T P B(Q)-P Q=\int_{q=0}^{Q} M P B(q) d q-P Q
$$

Note that

$$
\int_{q=0}^{Q} P d q=[P q]_{q=0}^{Q}=P Q-0=P Q 
$$

Thus we have

$$
C S(Q)=\int_{q=0}^{Q} M P B(q) d q-\int_{q=0}^{Q} P d q
$$


This can be rewritten as

$$
C S(Q)=\int_{q=0}^{Q}(M P B(q)-P) d q
$$

In other words, if $0 \leqslant Q \leqslant Q^{D}(P)$, then under some circumstances, the consumer surplus from purchasing $Q$ units of a commodity is equal to the area below the inverse demand (or marginal benefit) schedule and above the price line from $q=0$ to $q=Q$



Recall our linear marginal benefit schedule example in which the marginal benefit schedule is given by

$$
M B(q)=a-b q
$$

The demand curve associated with this linear marginal benefit schedule is also linear. It is given by

$$
Q^{D}(P)=\frac{a}{b}-\frac{1}{b} P
$$

If the prevailing price is equal to $P_{0}$, then the consumer will choose to purchase $Q_{0}=Q^{D}\left(P_{0}\right)=\frac{a}{b}-\frac{1}{b} P_{0}$ units of the commodity

The consumer surplus associated with this purchase is equal to the area of a triangle with a base length of $\left(Q_{0}-0\right)=Q_{0}$ units and a perpendicular height length of $\left(a-P_{0}\right)=P_{0}$ dollars-per-unit (assuming that prices are expressed in dollars)


Thus we have

$$
\operatorname{CS}\left(Q_{0}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left\{\left(a-P_{0}\right) Q_{0}\right\} \text { dollars. }
$$

If we substitute in the value for $Q_{0}$, we obtain:

$$
\operatorname{CS}\left(Q_{0}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left\{\left(a-P_{0}\right)\left(\frac{a}{b}-\frac{1}{b} P_{0}\right)\right\} \text { dollars. }
$$

This can be rewritten as

$$
\operatorname{CS}\left(Q_{0}\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{a^{2}}{b}-2 \frac{a}{b} P_{0}+\frac{1}{b} P_{0}^{2}\right) \text { dollars. }
$$

This example is illustrated in the diagram below. The consumer surplus is equal to shaded region in that diagram

Consumer surplus (linear inverse demand curve)
```



Up until now, we have been calculating consumer surplus from the marginal benefit (or inverse demand) schedule by summing or integrating with respect to quantity
We can also calculate consumer surplus from the (direct) demand schedule by summing or integrating with respect to price

Suppose that $\bar{P}$ is the lowest price at which the quantity demanded is zero. We will call this the consumer's "reservation price" for the commodity in question. In some cases, this reservation price will be finite. In other cases, it will be infinite

Note that $q^{D}(p)=0$ for all $p \geqslant \bar{P}$, while $q^{D}(p)>0$ for all $p<\bar{P}$
The consumer surplus that results when the price of the commodity is $P$ is

$$
\operatorname{CS}(P)=\int_{p=P}^{\bar{P}} q^{D}(p) d p
$$

### Changes in consumer surplus

We are sometimes interested in the impact of a change in the price of a commodity on the welfare of a consumer
This can be measured by the change in consumer surplus that results from the change in the price of the commodity

Suppose that the price of the commodity is initially $P_{0}$. At this price, the consumer demands $Q_{0}=q^{D}\left(P_{0}\right)$ units of the commodity
The initial consumer surplus in terms of quantity is

$$
C S\left(Q_{0}\right)=\int_{q=0}^{Q_{0}}\left(\operatorname{MPB}(q)-P_{0}\right) d q
$$

The initial consumer surplus in terms of price is

$$
C S\left(P_{0}\right)=\int_{p=P_{0}}^{\bar{P}} q^{D}(p) d p
$$


Suppose that the price of the commodity increases from $P_{0}$ to $P_{1}>P_{0}$. At the new price, the consumer demands $Q_{1}=q^{D}\left(P_{1}\right)$ units of the commodity
The new consumer surplus in terms of quantity is

$$
C S\left(Q_{1}\right)=\int_{q=0}^{Q_{1}}\left(\operatorname{MPB}(q)-P_{1}\right) d q
$$

The new consumer surplus in terms of price is

$$
C S\left(P_{1}\right)=\int_{p=P_{1}}^{\bar{P}} q^{D}(p) d p
$$



Using the price approach, the change in consumer surplus that results from the increase in price from $P_{0}$ to $P_{1}>P_{0}$ is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta C S\left(P_{0}, P_{1}\right) &=C S\left(P_{1}\right)-C S\left(P_{0}\right)=\int_{p=P_{1}}^{\bar{P}} q^{D}(p) d p-\int_{p=P_{0}}^{\bar{P}} q^{D}(p) d p \\
&=\int_{p=P_{1}} q^{D}(p) d p-\left\{\int_{p=P_{0}}^{P_{1}} q^{D}(p) d p+\int_{p=P_{1}}^{\bar{P}} q^{D}(p) d p\right\} \\
&=\int_{p=P_{1}}^{\bar{P}} q^{D}(p) d p-\int_{p=P_{0}}^{P_{1}} q^{D}(p) d p-\int_{p=P_{1}}^{\bar{P}} q^{D}(p) d p \\
&=-\int_{p=P_{0}}^{P_{1}} q^{D}(p) d p
\end{aligned}
$$


```{figure} _static/img/lecture_10/change_cs_1.png

:align: center

Total change in consumer surplus
```



Using the quantity approach, the change in consumer surplus that results from the increase in price from $P_{0}$ to $P_{1}>P_{0}$ is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{\Delta CS}\left(Q_{0}, Q_{1}\right)&= CS\left(Q_{1}\right)-C S\left(Q_{0}\right) \\
&=\int_{q=0}^{Q_{1}}\left(\operatorname{MPB}(q)-P_{1}\right) d q-\int_{q=0}^{Q_{0}}\left(\operatorname{MPB}(q)-P_{0}\right) d q \\
&=\int_{q=0}^{Q_{1}}\left(\operatorname{MPB}(q)-P_{1}\right) d q \\
-\left\{\int_{q=0}^{Q_{1}}\left(\operatorname{MPB}(q)-P_{0}\right) d q+\int_{q=Q_{1}}^{Q_{0}}\left(\operatorname{MPB}(q)-P_{0}\right) d q\right\}\\ &=\int_{q=0}^{Q_{1}}\left(M P B(q)-P_{1}\right) d q \\
-\int_{q=0}^{Q_{1}}\left(M P B(q)-P_{0}\right) d q-\int_{q=Q_{1}}^{Q_{0}}\left(M P B(q)-P_{0}\right) d q \\
&=\int_{q=0}^{Q_{1}}\left[\left(M P B(q)-P_{1}\right)-\left(M P B(q)-P_{0}\right)\right] d q \\
-\int_{q=Q_{1}}^{Q_{0}}\left(M P B(q)-P_{0}\right) d q \\
&=\int_{q=0}^{Q_{1}}\left[M P B(q)-P_{1}-\operatorname{MPB}(q)+P_{0}\right] d q-\int_{q=Q_{1}}^{Q_{0}}\left(M P B(q)-P_{0}\right) d q \\
& =\int_{q=0}^{Q_{1}}\left(P_{0}-P_{1}\right) d q-\int_{q=Q_{1}}^{Q_{0}}\left(\operatorname{MPB}(q)-P_{0}\right) d q \\
&= -\int_{q=0}^{Q_{1}}\left(P_{1}-P_{0}\right) d q-\int_{q=Q_{1}}^{Q_{0}}\left(\operatorname{MPB}(q)-P_{0}\right) d q \\
&= -\left\{\int_{q=0}^{Q_{1}}\left(P_{1}-P_{0}\right) d q+\int_{q=Q_{1}}^{Q_{0}}\left(\operatorname{MPB}(q)-P_{0}\right) d q\right\} 
\end{aligned}
$$


Thus we have

$$
\begin{gathered}
\Delta C S\left(Q_{0}, Q_{1}\right)=C S\left(Q_{1}\right)-C S\left(Q_{0}\right) \\
=-\left\{\int_{q=0}^{Q_{1}}\left(P_{1}-P_{0}\right) d q+\int_{q=Q_{1}}^{Q_{0}}\left(\operatorname{MPB}(q)-P_{0}\right) d q\right\} \\
=-\{\text { Area A }+ \text { Area B }\} 
\end{gathered}
$$

# Producer supply and producer welfare 


## Marginal private cost and supply

The marginal cost of supplying an additional unit of a good is the minimum amount that a producer would need to be paid to supply that additional unit, given the current production level of the good without the additional unit

The marginal private cost schedule for a good is a function of the form $M C(Q$; *other* $)$, where $Q$ is the quantity of the good that is supplied, *other* is the values that are taken by a set of other factors that affect the marginal cost of the good in question and $M C(Q ;$ *other* $)$ is the cost incurred by the producer from the production of the last of the $Q$ units of the good

As a matter of convenience, we will often write $M C(Q ;$ *other* $)$ as simply $M C(Q)$


### Increasing marginal costs

We will assume that the marginal private cost schedule displays increasing marginal costs
In other words, holding the values of the things that are in *other* fixed, the cost of producing a further unit of the good (that is, the marginal cost) will increase as $Q$ increases

This means that the marginal private cost schedule for a good will be upward sloping in $(Q, P)$-space

We will provide two justifications for this assumption, both of which make use of the concept of "diminishing marginal returns". The first justification will be in the context of a pure exchange economy. The second justification will be in the context of a production economy


### Marginal cost in a pure exchange economy

A **pure exchange economy** is one in which no production takes place. Each agent in the economy is endowed with some bundle of commodities. If an agent wants to consume some other bundle of commodities, then he or she must seek to conduct one or more trades with other agents in an attempt to obtain that bundle

Here we will consider a simple partial equilibrium version of a pure exchange economy. In other words, we will focus on the market for a single commodity. Indeed, we will focus on the behaviour of a single agent with respect to that commodity

As in our discussion of consumer demand, we will assume that this agent receives diminishing marginal benefits from the consumption of this commodity. This means that his or her marginal benefit schedule will be downward sloping


- If this consumer desires more of the good than his or her endowment of it, then he or she will need to purchase the additional units. This constitutes a situation of "net demand"
- If this consumer desires less of the good than his or her endowment of it, then he or she will be able to sell the additional units. This constitutes a situation of "net supply"
- This situation is depicted in the diagram below
    - Notice that "supply" of the good is measured in the leftwards direction in this diagram. This is because "supply" of an additional unit involves giving up an additional unit of "demand"
    - If we want to obtain the supply schedule for this agent, we simply need to flip the diagram. This is done in the second diagram below
    - The marginal cost schedule in the second diagram slopes up precisely because the marginal benefit schedule in the first diagram slopes down. In other words, increasing marginal costs follows directly from the behavioural assumption of diminishing marginal benefits

Marginal cost in a pure exchange economy

### Short-run marginal cost in a production economy

Suppose that the output of of good $(Q)$ can be produced using two inputs, capital $(K)$ and labour $(L)$ according to a production technology that can be represented by a profuction function $Q=F(L, K)$
In the short-run, the capital stock is fixed at $K=K_{0}$, so that the short-run production function is given by $Q=F\left(L ; K_{0}\right)=f(L)$

We will assume that this production technology displays a diminishing marginal product of labour. This means that the production of each additional unit of output in the short-run (when the capital stock is fixed) requires the use of more labour than the previous unit of output
If the producer is a price-taker in the labour market, so that every unit of labour costs $w$ per unit, then the presence of a diminishing marginal product of labour results in an increasing marginal cost of output

This situation is depicted in the following two diagrams

Diminishing marginal product of labour implies increasing SR marginal cost

### Increasing marginal cost once again

The idea that, in general, marginal costs are increasing, is nicely presented in the following quote from {cite:ps}`alchian1983` (p. 63)

> "Normally, at higher prices rates of production are higher and amounts supplied are larger. (Remember, when we say that a price is higher or lower, we mean the *relative* price - that one price, in dollars, relative to prices, in dollars, of other goods and services.) Higher rates of production of any good require more resources. And resources, like goods, remember, are scarce. For example, say we want to expand the national annual output of wheat. The amount of arable land having the best soil composition and located in the best climate is limited, and virtually all of it is already in use. Thus, land more valuable for corn or cattle must be diverted to wheat. Resources that are increasingly more valuable elsewhere must be attracted."


### Short-run costs and long-run costs

In economics, the difference between short-run and long-run depends on whether or not it is possible to vary all of the factors of production

- In the short-run, at least some factors of production are fixed. The quantity of these fixed factors that is employed cannot be varied in the short-run. These fixed factors of production must be paid for their services. Fixed costs are simply payments for the services of these fixed factors of production. Short-run variable costs relate to payments made to factors of production that can be varied in the short-run. Short-run total cost is equal to the sum of short-run fixed cost and short-run variable cost
- In the long-run, all factors of production can be varied. As such, there are no fixed costs in the long-run. All long-run costs are variable costs. Long-run total cost is equal to long-run variable cost


### Total variable costs and marginal costs

The total variable cost of producing $Q$ units of output is simply the sum of the marginal cost of producing each of those units of output
- If output must be produced in discrete units, this means that

$$
TVC(Q)=M C(1)+M C(2)+\cdots+M C(Q)=\sum_{q=1}^{Q} M C(Q)
$$

- If output is infinitely divisible, this means that

$$
TVC(Q)=\int_{q=0}^{Q} M C(q) d q
$$

In both of these cases, the total variable cost of producing $Q$ units of output is simply the area under the marginal cost schedule and above the quantity axis between $q=0$ and $q=Q$
This is illustrated for the case in which output is infinitely divisible below

### Producer revenue

Consider a producer of some commodity who is a price-taker in the market for that commodity. Suppose that the price of the commodity is $P$

Recall that the producer's marginal cost schedule can be interpreted as his or her inverse supply schedule. Thus we can find the maximum quantity of the commodity that the producer is willing to supply by determining the quantity at which the price line intersects the marginal cost schedule. Suppose that this quantity is given $Q=q^{S}(P)$

The total revenue that the producer receives from sales of $Q$ units of the commodity at a price of $P$ per unit is simply $R=P Q$
This area is equal to the area of the shaded region in the diagram below

### Producer's surplus

The revenue that a producer receives from sales of the commodity is, in a sense, the total benefit to the producer from producing that quantity of the commodity
However, the production of the commodity costs the producer some resources
Thus the net benefit to the producer from the sale of $Q$ units of a commodity is less than the total revenue from those sales

In order to obtain the welfare gain (or net benefit) to the producer from sales of the commodity, we need to subtract the opportunity costs of production from revenue
As a first step in this process, let us ignore any fixed costs of production that might exist
If we subtract total variable costs from revenue, we obtain what is known as producer's surplus

- If output must be produced in discrete units and $Q=q^{S}(P)$, then producer's surplus is given by

$$
P S(Q)=P Q-\left(\sum_{q=1}^{Q} M C(q)\right)
$$

- If output is infinitely divisible and $Q=q^{S}(P)$, then producer's surplus is given by

$$
P S(Q)=P Q-\left(\int_{q=0}^{Q} M C(q) d q\right)
$$

Producer's surplus is equal to the area of the shaded region in the diagram below (for the case in which output is infinitely divisible)

#### Producer's surplus and profit

One possible measure of producer welfare in this setting is given by the profit received by a producer. Another possible measure is that of producer's surplus. What is the relationship between these measures?

The profit from selling $Q$ units of a commodity is equal to the revenue received from those sales minus the total cost of producing those $Q$ units of the commodity being sold: $\Pi(Q)=P Q-T C(Q)$

Recall that total cost is equal to the sum of fixed cost and total variable cost: $T C(Q)=F+T V C(Q)$
- Thus we have: $\Pi(Q)=P Q-T V C(Q)-F$

Recall that the producer's surplus from selling $Q$ units of a commodity is equal to the revenue received from those sales minus the total variable cost of producing those $Q$ units of the commodity being sold: $P S(Q)=P Q-T V C(Q)$
- Thus we have $\Pi(Q)=P S(Q)-F$, which can be rearranged to obtain $P S(Q)=\Pi(Q)+F$



In the long-run, there are no fixed factors of production and hence no fixed costs
As such, we know that in a long-run competitive equilibrium, we have $P S(Q)=\Pi(Q)$
Thus there is no ambiguity about which welfare measure to use for producers in the long-run

But what about the short-run? Should we use $P S(Q)$ or $\Pi(Q)$ as the measure of producer welfare?
Recall that the fixed cost does not vary with the chosen output level. It must be paid (in the short-run) even if the producer shuts down the production plant and produces nothing. As such, the fixed cost is a "sunk cost"

Sunk costs are not part of the true short-run opportunity cost of producing any chosen level of output because they cannot be avoided. This means that they should not be included in the calculation of short-run producer welfare
In other words, the appropriate measure of short-run producer welfare (and long-run producer welfare for that matter) is given by producer's surplus
